# Giphy

This is a web application that is integrated with the Giphy API. Upon clicking the preconfigured buttons, the application makes a GET call to Giphy and renders the first ten gifs coming back in the response. 

You may also type in any animal of your choice in the provided text box to create a new button and then view the gifs returned from the Giphy API.

Upon viewing the gifs you may click on them to start and stop the animation.
